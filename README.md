## Introduction
This project aims to provide a robust solution for detecting spam comments on YouTube using machine learning techniques. It leverages a variety of text processing techniques and classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy in spam detection.

## Features
- Detects spam comments with high precision and recall.
- Supports batch processing of YouTube comments.
- Easy integration with existing systems.
- Pre-trained model included for quick setup.

## Model Architecture
The classifier is built using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques:
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings.
- **Classification Algorithms:** Utilizes models like Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks for spam detection.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of YouTube comments collected from various channels, labeled as either 'spam' or 'not spam'. The dataset includes:
- Number of comments: `x,xxx`
- Number of spam comments: `x,xxx`
- Number of non-spam comments: `x,xxx`
